      <description>Hello everyone! Welcome to today&amp;rsquo;s devtalk! In this session, we&amp;rsquo;ll be delving into the fascinating realm of subtitles.&#xA;Subtitler The entirety of my subtitle system (conveniently nicknamed &amp;ldquo;Subtitler&amp;rdquo;) is open-source and available over at my github&#xD;!&#xA;During development, I quickly realized that some in-game dialogue may be hard to hear. Implementing a subtitle system was the most obvious solution. However, as the game scaled, it turned out to be a bit more complex than I initially anticipated.</description>

      <description>Heya everyone! It&amp;rsquo;s time for a healthy dose of tech talk, where I rant about how I developed Nightshift. This time we are looking at the graphics, environment, and optimization efforts in Nightshift (This will not cover ray-tracing as that was more of an experiment than a feature, and is currently not even performant enough to be considered usable).&#xA;Lighting Ječná Nightshift environment is lit by various artificial lights ranging from hallway lamps, monitors, and flashlight down to table lamps.</description>

      <description>Greetings everyone! Its time for some Gasimo Tech Tips, where I rant about some of the systems I have developed for Nightshift (some are open-sourced over at my github!). This one focuses on the interaction framework.&#xA;Interaction System This is one of the first components I have developed for Nightshift back in the day where it was just a demonstration student project. I wanted to get rid of the commonly used raycast-based system, which plagues the majority of first person indie horror games.</description>
