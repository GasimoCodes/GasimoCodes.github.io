      <description>Another semester, another gamejam! Since Amanita Design was the organizer of the jam, it was only fitting the theme turned out to be &amp;ldquo;Fungipunk&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;For our game we decided to create a tiny tycoon filled with so-called &amp;ldquo;industrial shrooms&amp;rdquo;. Sadly due to time-limits we were not able to deliver as good and vast game we had initially imagined. Selecting Godot also slowed us a bit as I had no prior experience in it, but I believe it was worth it since I learned some new software workflows!</description>
