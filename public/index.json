This time, I\u0026rsquo;ve finally gotten to remaking the ship controller. But wait, there\u0026rsquo;s more! This month was brought to you by our Patrons Walpar, Pitti, Kyle and Vaipu.\nNew Ship! I have remade the controls, added (faked) buoyancy, added sonar, and made a new model. It\u0026rsquo;s a major improvement over the last version\u0026rsquo;s ship system, and I feel pretty confident about it going forward!","date":"2024-06-14T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://gasimo.dev/blog/etherdev7/","tags":["Ether","Devlog"],"title":"Ether Devlog 7"},{"author":"Gasimo","categories":null,"contents":"Hello everyone!
