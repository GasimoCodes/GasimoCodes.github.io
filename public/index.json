Its that time of the month again! This month was quite an eventful one for Ether. I made a bunch of both graphical and gameplay improvements. Lets go one by one.\nBunker The bunker has received a major lighting redo and some layout updates to better serve gameplay. The player now needs to go into a bigger control room to use the computer and fancy instruments.","date":"2023-11-29T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://gasimo.dev/blog/etherdev3/","tags":["Ether","Devlog"],"title":"Ether Devlog 3"},{"author":"Gasimo","categories":null,"contents":"Me and my friends Barbo and Ondrej competed in the 42 hours GDS Gamejam!

You possess the ability to rift between alternate versions of reality.

Welcome to today\u0026rsquo;s devtalk! In this session, we\u0026rsquo;ll be delving into the fascinating realm of subtitles.\nSubtitler The entirety of my subtitle system (conveniently nicknamed \u0026ldquo;Subtitler\u0026rdquo;) is open-source and available over at my github\r!\nDuring development, I quickly realized that some in-game dialogue may be hard to hear. Implementing a subtitle system was the most obvious solution. However, as the game scaled, it turned out to be a bit more complex than I initially anticipated.","date":"2023-11-20T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://gasimo.dev/blog/nightshifttech2/","tags":["Nightshift","Tech"],"title":"Tech behind Ječná Part 3: Subtitles"},{"author":"Gasimo","categories":null,"contents":"Heya everyone! It\u0026rsquo;s time for a healthy dose of tech talk, where I rant about how I developed Nightshift.

Its time for some Gasimo Tech Tips, where I rant about some of the systems I have developed for Nightshift (some are open-sourced over at my github!). This one focuses on the interaction framework.\nInteraction System This is one of the first components I have developed for Nightshift back in the day where it was just a demonstration student project. I wanted to get rid of the commonly used raycast-based system, which plagues the majority of first person indie horror games.","date":"2023-11-04T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://gasimo.dev/blog/nightshifttech1/","tags":["Nightshift","Tech"],"title":"Tech behind Ječná Part 1: Interaction System"},{"author":"Gasimo","categories":null,"contents":"(This post\rwas released 3 days ago to my supporters over at Patreon: Walpar, Vaipu and Kyle!)\nHello everyone!\nDuring the last 20 days Ive put some work into the environment.
