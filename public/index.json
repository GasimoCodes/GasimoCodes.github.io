The raycast system relies on players looking pixel perfect at the item they want to interact with, which can be really difficult when it comes to small objects like keys and twice as difficult when using gamepads! My system instead only requires the player to look in the approximate direction of the object and it chooses the object automatically (like the big boy AAA games often do).
