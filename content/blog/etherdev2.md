Hello everyone!

During the last 20 days Ive put some work into the environment. The blocky prototyping aesthetic of the previous devlog just wasnt fun enough to walk through during development.

As part of the visual update, the CRT monitor(s) in the base got a new CRTish shader which I made to mimick the effect when you move your camera close to the monitor (The effect fades with distance to prevent it from distracting the player)

The exterior environment is in the process of getting some nice cliffs too!

A small visual feedback update with the computer makes background windows border gray instead of just darkening the content:

The SatInsight rendering now has more sat-like colors and icons fade out when signal gets lost

**There are also more small updates like:**

- Shop now has shoppable items which (upon being bought) get spawned in your base (A new Upgrades tab is being worked on)
- The generators part of the map got a rework too
- Lights now dont have to turn on automatically when power is restored
- Power-related bugfixes
- Some new props and illustrations
- And some stuff which I forgot to list, probably...

**In terms of what needs to be done:**

- Shop system upgradeables!
- Better boat controls (alot)
- File player for the computer
- Hunger related mechanics + lack of sleep debuff
- Weather, Extreme weather events + Ability to see weather on Radar (Clouds and thunder is now wip but I am not sure if its gonna be in next devlog)
- Enemies and events (I keep that for last)
- Theres always room for general polish

- And more...
