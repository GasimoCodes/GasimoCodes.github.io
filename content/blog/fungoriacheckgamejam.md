Another semester, another gamejam! Since Amanita Design was the organizer of the jam, it was only fitting the theme turned out to be "Fungipunk".<br>
For our game we decided to create a tiny tycoon filled with so-called "industrial shrooms". Sadly due to time-limits we were not able to deliver as good and vast game we had initially imagined. Selecting Godot also slowed us a bit as I had no prior experience in it, but I believe it was worth it since I learned some new software workflows!

## Premise

In a hunt for a sustainable energy source, the humans are now testing newly discovered species of industrial shrooms out far away on a secluded island. 
<br>
Be the shroom. Expand your shroom network, generate energy, store water and evolve in this tiny tycoon!
