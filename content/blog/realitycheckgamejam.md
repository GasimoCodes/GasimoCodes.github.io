Me and my friends Barbo and Ondrej competed in the 42 hours GDS Gamejam! [You can play our submission over at my Itch.io page!](https://gasimo.itch.io/reality-check)

{{< youtube H33pxOtwQ8E >}}


## Whats Reality Check?
Its a stylized puzzle-platformer, where you play as a silly wizard being exploring the world with a twist. You possess the ability to rift between alternate versions of reality. One being authentic while the other is a facade of the real world.

## Gameplay
Solve puzzles, explore dual worlds, and collect some shiny stars.

## Tools used
This game was developed using **Unity**, **Studio One**, and hand-drawn in **Asesprite**. All gameplay code and visual assets were made by us during the gamejam and *might* be open sourced in the future!
