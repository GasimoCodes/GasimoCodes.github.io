Heyo everyone! It's time for the nearly-monthly Ether update! This month has been given to polishing the ship and bringing the world to life with some needed water & flora changes! Let's *dive* in!

### EMF Camera

Ether now features an EMF Camera which allows you to trace EMF traces in the field. Source of the interference can be devices, natural phenomena but also anomalies.

When you encounter a strong EMF Source, you can use the EMF Camera to record it to be later played (and uploaded) at the base.

### Sea

The sea shading in Ether was kinda boring (absolutely can't let that fly). After some research I have implemented a new solution which allows for eye-candy effects such as waves, sub-surface scattering & buoyancy! It took a couple days but I believe it was well-worth it.

### Foliage

Thanks to you I was able to afford a brand new mountain-y vegetation pack for Ether which helps eliminate the plain feel of the landscape back from when it was just grass.

(There are some bugs with the shader which causes tiny blue artifacting on the transparent parts of the foliage but I hope to get these fixed by next month)

### ...Caves?

Caves have been roughly laid out and prototyped. I will post some pictures of those once they look fancier.

### Others

* Added 3 new misc signals to the SDR
* Added downloadable signal sample for introductory email
* Added 2 environmental anomalies
* Added 1 "smart" anomaly
* Textured IMC ship
* RC3 files can now be replayed in the File Manager
* Added Buoys and redone few map areas

### To-Do's:

* More story signals, More random signals
* More threats and random anomalies
* Environment puzzles and few locations
* LORE!
* Dreams, Sleep mechanics
