Heyos Everyone! Its a new year and alongside it comes a new Ether devlog.
([This post was released a week in advance for my Patrons Walpar, Kyle, Pitti and Vaipu!](https://www.patreon.com/posts/95856614/))

### **Terrain Change**
The map is receiving a major redo. I wanted to make the 'home' island bigger, mountains taller and environment more natural and faithful to Greenland. This also allows me to fit more landmarks to explore for the player.

### **Upgradeables, Upgrade!**
The shop now includes a tab where you can overview base upgrades. The whole system is in place, allowing me to add in more upgradeables down the road very easily.

 ### **Lore is being written**

I have drastically expanded on the worldbuilding. The docs have been moved into Notion, which allows for better organisation of everything. We have already laid down a couple events which may happen in the first few days of the game and I will implement them later in development.

All suggestions for events, lore or enemies are welcome!

### **Clouds and atmosphere!**
I have completely replaced the weather system. The new one promises MUCH better performance and customizability.

 ### **Beep Boop!**
Your workdesk now includes a report panel. This is an array of indicator lights which will start blinking to alert you about anything worth noticing within the base.
