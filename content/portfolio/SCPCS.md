SCP Classified Site is a Unity Crossplatform Multiplayer game I co-founded and developed alongside Aizyka. 

Notable things I have developed for CS is the **Spherecast-based Interaction System**, **Inventory & Item Logic** and Architecture and **Random Map Generator**. In the first year after release the game obtained over 1 milion downloads from the Play Store alone.
